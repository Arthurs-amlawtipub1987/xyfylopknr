Just walked out of the theater, my head still buzzing like a hive full of jittery bees. In the Lost Lands really threw me into another realm or was it more like a sprawled mess of realms? I can’t even — where do I start?

So, right, there was this scene, you know, with the wolves, or were they shapeshifters? It’s all so tangled up in my head like my earphones after, ugh, such a hassle. And the noise! Someone rustling popcorn, shards of it crunching beneath boots, an echo throughout the place. Kept pulling me back to reality every time I tried to dive into the misty landscapes onscreen. Back aching from those seats, never designed for comfort, like they made them out of ancient stone or something.

> Did you see how the land itself felt like a whole character? I swear it whispered secrets if you really paid attention. But maybe it was just the nacho cheese dripping onto my sleeve, creating Rorschach-like shapes distracting me with their own mysterious stories.

What was that scene with the mirror? Or were they portals? I lost track like a tourist without a map, just willingly stumbling into whatever came next. Gray Alys—the name alone like a cold wind in an empty corridor, such an enigma. Oh, and the dragon! Or was it a dragon? I’m convinced it was just a metaphor for lost dreams or maybe I’m just reading into it too much like when you try to find constellations where there aren’t any.

Anyway, someone asked if you can 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  —or 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮? God, I can’t remember. But 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 it in a theater felt like stepping into someone else’s dream — like tripping over and landing in Alice’s Wonderland, but darker, and more suffused with shades of secrets.

And those random whispers behind me, like specters of chatty ghosts that couldn't find their way out. Curious eyes glowing from the shadows onscreen, or were those just the lights catching reflections in the clutter of my thoughts? Shadows bleed into shadows until you can’t tell what's real—like trying to sort tangled Christmas lights two days before the holiday.

function 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩Movie() {
  var thoughts = [];
  for (var i = 0; i < scenes.length; i++) {
    thoughts.push(scenes[i].title);
    if (scenes[i].length > expected) {
      break;
    }
  }
  return memories.sort();
}

I’ll have to see it again. Or maybe not. Not sure my mind can untangle from this kaleidoscope anytime soon.
